Weather App is a simple web application built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
It shows the real-time weather information (temperature, description, location) by using the OpenWeatherMap API and the browser's Geolocation API.
Users can also toggle between Celsius and Fahrenheit by clicking on the temperature display.

✅ Live weather updates
